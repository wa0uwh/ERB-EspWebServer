WebServer_erb

This Program Provides the following for the Esp8266 as a WebServer:  
But CAUTION, some functionallity may not have been throughly tested.  

The purpose of the program is to provide an Experimental Enviroment in which  
to create new functions that can be used in my other planned projects.  

Currently, all Arduino IDE TABS are '.ino' type files, which are compiled as a single blob.  
The structure of this progame could be better, as normally, the TABS should be set up  
as '.h', '.c', or '.cpp' files, but this is easier and quicker for my experimental efforts.  
Future revisions may be properly constructed.  

Features:

      All Web Pages are Dynamically Generated by The Esp8266 Processor  
      Implemented Full (1460 bytes) WIFI Buffered Transfers  
      All String Constants are saved in Flash, freeing RAM/Heap, via F(), sF(), and FMT() macros.  
      Uses ICACHE_FLASH_ATTR to dynamically load seldom used program functions

      Implemented SVG Gauge for FreeHeap  
      Implemented SVG Gauge for Vdd  
      Implemented SVG Line Graph for FreeHeap Historical Data, with Start and End of Page Markers  
           and reduced Data Transfer by removing Duplicate Y Data Points
